*infuse/libs* is a collection of libraries designed for rapid PHP development.

These libraries are unit-tested, battle-tested, and can be used à la carte. Each class has as few external dependencies as possible. Inspiration was drawn from many sources, in particular, the simplicity of node libraries like express.js.

## Infuse Framework
